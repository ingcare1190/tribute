      <p>José de la Cruz Porfirio Díaz Mori (15 September 1830 – 2 July 1915), known as Porfirio Díaz, was a Mexican general and politician who served seven terms as President of Mexico, a total of 31 years, from 28 November 1876 to 6 December 1876, 17 February 1877 to 1 December 1880 and from 1 December 1884 to 25 May 1911. The entire period from 1876 to 1911 is often referred to as the Porfiriato.</p>

        <h3 id="headline">Here's a time line of the Porfiriato:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>1872</strong> - President Benito Juárez dies of a heart attack on July 18. He is succeeded by the head of the Supreme Court of Justice, Sebastián Lerdo de Tejada. Porfirio Díaz is granted amnesty for his rebellion by Lerdo in November 1872. Díaz later rebels against Lerdo in 1876. Although Díaz was a rival of Juárez during his lifetime, after seizing power, he helped shape Juárez's historical memory.</li>
          <li>
            <strong>1878</strong> - Railway service begins at the San Lázaro train station to points in Puebla and Veracruz. It continued until the late 1970s when the station was demolished. It is remembered today only at the San Lazáro Metro Station and the San Lázaro Legislative Palace.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1888</strong> - Construction begins on the notorious Prison Complex of the Lecumberri Palace, later known as the "Black Palace of Lecumbrri," which initially opened as a prison for Porfirio Díaz's political enemies. The architect and designer, Miguel S. Macedo, was imprisoned there during the Mexican Revolution.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1894</strong> - The original Cuatro Caminos Bullring was named because the four roads connecting Azcapotzalco, Chapultepec, Naucalpan, and further east, Tenochtitlan, converge there. The Nahuatl root words give us the name Naucalpan. Made of wood and with a capacity for 30,000 people, the bullring was replaced in 1947 by the better-known steel dome where bullfights and events like concerts were regularly held until 1996. Today, the Cuatro Caminos Metro Station is still occasionally known as "Toreo," and once the bullring was demolished, one of the area's most important landmarks was lost.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1900</strong> - Construction of the Angel of Independence began. The work was completed about 10 years later, in time for the country's independence centenary.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1900</strong> - On November 20, Porfirio Díaz cut the ribbon at the opening of the Mercado de Paz in the Centro de Tlalpan.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1901</strong> - On November 18, the police arrested 41 men attending a dance near Avenida San Juan de Letrán (now Eje Central). Some of them were dressed as women, and it is likely that the 42nd person was Porfirio Díaz's son-in-law, who barely escaped arrest. The modern LGBTQ+ movement in the city still traces its history back to this event.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1903</strong> - California immigrants Walter and Frank Sanborn opened Mexico's first soda fountain and lunch counter in front of the Palacio de Correos. This first Sanborns location continues to operate, but the chain acquired its most famous branch two blocks south of La Casa de los Azulejos in 1919.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1904</strong> - Porfirio Díaz lays the cornerstone of the Palacio de Bellas Artes. The building was not completed until 1934.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1904 – 1911</strong> - Architect Silvio Contri begins working on what is now the National Museum of Art (MUNAL), in Neoclassical and Renaissance styles. It was built to house the Secretariat of Communications and Public Works.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1910</strong> - Construction begins on a new Federal Legislative Palace, planned since 1897. The project was not completed until 1938, at which point it became the Monument to the Revolution.
          </li>
          <li><strong>1910</strong> - Porfirio Díaz officially inaugurates Avenida Centenario, running from the north of Tacuba to the administrative building of Azcapotzalco City Hall. It was the first street to feature asphalt and electric lighting in its lampposts.</li>
